I am a professor of mathematics with the University of Wisconsin - Superior.  
I am tasked with writing a text about Calculus 1 with a certain philosophy.
After some research, I believe that using Pretext via github is the right approach.
Unfortunately, I know absolutely nothing about either of them.
As an old school LAMP web site coder, learning Pretext is quick.
But, the learning curve on github is massive.  I know nothing about it and it seems like a maze to me.
Any help is seriously welcomed.

Thanks.
